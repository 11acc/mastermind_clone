Grading:
Complexity Analysis
	Every function was documented with R.U. - Worst & Avg cases
	The analysis of the functions was accurate

Algorithms
	More than one algorithms
	Each algorithm solves a particular problem within the game logic

Data Structures
	More than 1 data structure from those we studied
	Each solving a particular problem

Efficiency
	The algorithms have to be the best performing from their kind
	None are the worst kind

Correctness
	Game runs fine considering coner cases in game logic

Presentation
	All members fully understand the presentation
	Work was perfectly split
	Everyone knows what the others did
